# Revyl CLI Dev Loop Skill

Use this skill when the user wants the generic Revyl CLI dev loop instead of MCP tool-by-tool orchestration. Start from the app's real stack, keep the session running, and use the device as the source of truth.

## Native Agent Behavior

- Ask at most 1-3 concise clarification questions only when the target app, platform, session, URL, or sensitive action cannot be inferred from the repo or Revyl CLI.
- Prefer safe defaults and keep moving when `revyl init --detect`, `revyl dev list`, `revyl app list`, screenshots, or reports can answer the question.
- When Revyl prints a viewer or local app URL, open it in the native browser/tool surface when available: Codex Browser/in-app browser for local URLs, Revyl viewer URLs, screenshots, and page checks; Claude Code `.claude/skills` slash-command discovery plus WebFetch/WebSearch or configured MCP/browser tools; Cursor `.cursor/skills` plus `.cursor/rules/revyl-skills.mdc` and available MCP/browser tools.
- If no browser tool is exposed, report the URL and verify through `revyl device screenshot` or `revyl device report` instead of claiming browser access.
- Confirm before entering sensitive data, submitting forms, uploading files, accepting browser permissions, changing sharing/access, or deleting data.

## Detect and Start

```bash
# Initialize or refresh project detection.
revyl init --detect

# Start the dev loop for the default platform (iOS is the default).
revyl dev
```

When platform matters, make it explicit:

```bash
revyl dev --platform ios
revyl dev --platform android
```

If detection picks the wrong provider, force the provider during init instead of editing around a bad config:

```bash
revyl init --provider expo
revyl init --provider react-native
```

In monorepos, run Revyl from the actual app directory, not the workspace root. For example, use `apps/mobile` for an Expo app even if the repo root also has a `.revyl/` directory.

## Start or Attach

Use normal `revyl dev` for new work. Contexts are worktree-local; separate
worktrees can each use the default context. If another loop is already running
in the same worktree, Revyl auto-selects a safe branch/platform context name
and prints it. Pass `--context <name>` only when deliberately targeting a known
loop.

```bash
# New loop: let Revyl provision the device and choose any needed context name.
revyl dev

# Inspect or switch named contexts only when you need to target one explicitly.
revyl dev list
revyl dev use <name>
revyl dev --context <name>
```

Attach only when you are intentionally reusing an already-running device
session:

```bash
# Reuse the current active session only when it is unambiguous.
revyl dev attach active --context <name>
revyl dev

# If multiple sessions exist, attach by explicit session id or index.
revyl dev attach <session-id> --context <name>
revyl dev attach <index> --context <name>
revyl dev
```

`active` is a convenience shortcut for the current running device session. Do
not use it when multiple sessions exist or when the desired session is unclear.
After attaching a session to a context, run `revyl dev` from that worktree to
start the loop on that session, or pass `--context <name>` if you need to
target the attached context explicitly.

## Framework Guidance

- Expo: use the Revyl-managed relay and Expo dev client for JS/TS hot
  reload. Rebuild only when native config, native modules, SDK/native
  dependencies, permissions, or URL scheme registration changes. Try an
  external Expo tunnel only after screenshots or reports show the Revyl relay,
  app load, or HMR path failed. If repeated web auth is slowing stable Expo
  testing, install and use `revyl-cli-auth-bypass`; let it detect the stack and
  delegate to `revyl-cli-auth-bypass-expo` for Expo app code. Implement the
  test-only bypass in the app first, then add an `auth_bypass` section to
  `.revyl/config.yaml` (see Auth Bypass below) so `revyl dev` applies the
  launch vars and fires the `revyl-auth` deep link automatically.
- React Native bare: use the Metro relay. No `app_scheme` is needed because
  the device loads the JS bundle over the Revyl relay. JS/TS changes hot
  reload; native dependency, Podfile, Gradle, or native source changes need a
  rebuild. Do not use Expo tunnel fallback unless the app is actually an Expo
  dev-client flow.
- Flutter: use a rebuild-first loop. There is no Metro/Expo dev server for
  cloud hot reload; the binary is the app. `revyl dev` installs and runs the
  current build, and Dart file saves may auto-trigger rebuilds. In agent
  shells, use `revyl dev rebuild --wait` when an explicit rebuild is needed,
  then verify on the device.
- Native iOS/Swift and native Android/Kotlin: use a rebuild-first loop. Xcode,
  Gradle, Kotlin, Swift, resource, manifest, or native dependency changes must
  build, upload or delta-push, reinstall, and relaunch in the cloud session.
  Expo tunnels do not fix these stacks.
- KMP, Bazel, and other native artifact flows: treat the configured
  `build.platforms.<key>.output` artifact as the app. Iterate through the
  configured build command, `revyl dev rebuild --wait`, and device verification.
- Monorepos: if detection is confused by hoisted dependencies or nested native folders, run from the app directory and force the provider only when needed.

If repeated login slows exploration on any stack, use `revyl-cli-auth-bypass`
first. It detects the app stack and delegates to the matching platform leaf
before this dev-loop skill starts the session with bypass launch vars.

## Observe, Act, Verify

Use screenshots and reports to decide what happened before changing strategy.

```bash
revyl device screenshot --out before.png
revyl device tap --target "Sign In button"
revyl device type --target "Email field" --text "user@example.com"
revyl device swipe --target "Product list" --direction down
revyl device instruction "Open the checkout screen"
revyl device screenshot --out after.png
revyl device report --session-id <session-id> --json
```

During exploration, capture the exact path that worked. Describe actions with visible target language and keep the path at intent level.

## Auth Bypass

Preferred: configure it once in `.revyl/config.yaml` and every session — cold
start, rebuild relaunch, reused session — launches authenticated with no flags:

```yaml
auth_bypass:
  launch_vars: [REVYL_AUTH_BYPASS_ENABLED, REVYL_AUTH_BYPASS_TOKEN]
  deep_link: "myapp://revyl-auth?token=${REVYL_AUTH_BYPASS_TOKEN}&redirect=/home"
```

`${VAR}` placeholders resolve from org launch-variable values at fire time.
The deep link fires automatically after every app (re)launch. If the app ever
shows a logged-out state mid-session (expired mint), recover by re-minting the
launch vars with the repo's own mint script (check the repo's AGENTS.md or
scripts/), then re-firing the deep link with fresh values:

```bash
revyl dev auth refresh --json
```

Manual fallback (no config section yet):

```bash
# One-time setup if the launch vars do not already exist.
export REVYL_AUTH_BYPASS_TOKEN="<test-only-token>"
revyl global launch-var create REVYL_AUTH_BYPASS_ENABLED=true
revyl global launch-var create REVYL_AUTH_BYPASS_TOKEN="$REVYL_AUTH_BYPASS_TOKEN"

revyl dev --no-build \
  --launch-var REVYL_AUTH_BYPASS_ENABLED \
  --launch-var REVYL_AUTH_BYPASS_TOKEN

# After the app loads, open the auth-bypass link from a separate shell:
revyl device navigate \
  --url "myapp://revyl-auth?token=$REVYL_AUTH_BYPASS_TOKEN&role=buyer&redirect=%2Fcheckout"
revyl device screenshot --out /tmp/revyl-auth-bypass.png
```

If the app has not implemented the handler yet, install/use
`revyl-cli-auth-bypass` first. It will delegate to the platform leaf (e.g.
`revyl-cli-auth-bypass-expo`) for the app-side handler, then add the
`auth_bypass` section to `.revyl/config.yaml` so future sessions need no
manual steps. Never paste launch-var values into code, logs, or PRs.

## Guardrails

1. Start from the detected app stack, then override only when detection is wrong.
2. Keep the dev loop running while using separate short-lived `revyl device` commands for interaction.
3. Prefer user-visible outcomes over implementation details.
4. Stop local loop cleanly with `Ctrl+C` or `revyl dev stop` when done.

## Agent Execution

`revyl dev` is a persistent process. In agent shells, prefer `--detach`: the
loop daemonizes itself and the command returns a machine-readable handshake as
soon as the device session is live (the build may still be running behind it).

```bash
# Preferred agent start: returns JSON with viewer_url within seconds. On a
# local machine the CLI also opens the viewer in the user's browser
# (opened_browser in the handshake; --no-open disables). Still post
# viewer_url as a clickable link; never open a browser yourself.
revyl dev --remote --detach --json    # native / rebuild-first stacks
revyl dev --detach --json             # hot-reload stacks

# Share viewer_url with the user immediately, then monitor until installed:
revyl dev status                      # state: building -> idle
revyl dev logs --build --follow       # stream remote build output
revyl dev status --wait-ready --timeout 300   # block until the session is live

# Iterate and stop:
revyl dev rebuild --wait --json
revyl dev stop --json
```

If `--detach` is unavailable (older CLI), fall back to the environment's
non-blocking shell mode:

1. **Background long-running loops** -- use the agent environment's non-blocking shell mode for `revyl dev`.
2. **Poll for readiness** -- `Hot reload ready` means the Expo/Metro transport
   is up; `Dev loop ready`, a viewer URL, or successful `revyl device` evidence
   means the full device loop is ready. If output stalls on device provisioning
   after `Hot reload ready`, debug the worker/device session path instead of
   changing the relay/tunnel strategy.
3. **Detect failures early** -- if the process exits or output contains
   `Error:` before the ready line, stop and report the error to the user.
4. **Device commands in a separate terminal** -- `revyl device tap`,
   `screenshot`, `type`, and `swipe` are short-lived. Run them in a
   different Shell call, not the dev-loop terminal.
5. **Do not interact with TTY prompts** -- the dev loop prints
   `[r] rebuild native + reinstall` and `[q] quit`. These require a real
   TTY. In agent shells, use `revyl dev rebuild`, `revyl dev stop`, or restart
   the loop instead.
6. **Attaching to an existing session** -- if no suitable session exists, run
   `revyl dev` normally and let Revyl choose the context. If exactly one
   relevant current session exists, attach it with
   `revyl dev attach active --context <name>`, then start with `revyl dev`.
   If multiple sessions exist, use an explicit session id or index; do not
   guess.
7. **Keep logs concise** -- use `revyl dev --debug` only for relay/HMR
   troubleshooting. When reporting results, summarize the state transitions and
   include only the first actionable error, relevant relay/session IDs, and a
   small log tail. Do not paste long spinner output or full debug streams unless
   the user asks for raw logs.

## Cloud Agent Relay Note

In Cursor or similar cloud-agent environments, start with the Revyl-managed
relay:

```bash
revyl dev --no-build --app-id <app-id>
```

If you need to target a specific existing loop, inspect contexts first with
`revyl dev list`, then run `revyl dev --context <name>`. Do not predefine a
context for normal startup; Revyl will pick one when the worktree needs it.

For Expo and bare React Native, this lets Revyl own Metro/Expo startup, relay
creation, dev-client install, and the deep link opened on the cloud device. If
the app does not load or hot reload does not apply changes, gather device
evidence before changing transport.

If startup fails with `failed to create relay session: unauthorized` after
`Backend relay connectivity OK`, do not assume the developer needs to log in
again. First run `revyl auth status` and `revyl ping`; if both pass, capture a
`revyl dev --debug` run and treat it as a Revyl relay/backend issue. For Expo
dev-client projects, use `--force-hot-reload` first when Revyl verifies relay
transport but cannot prove Expo manifest readiness.

After `Dev loop ready`, keep the process running. Treat `Viewer:` and the
relay/deep-link host printed by `revyl dev` as the active relay session; in
production this may be `relay.revyl.ai`, while local or branch environments may
use a generated relay/ngrok host. Do not stop the relay because of HMR
diagnostic warnings; normal runs hide advisory HMR diagnostics, and
`revyl dev --debug` is for relay/HMR troubleshooting.

For Expo manifest readiness timeouts, use diagnostic launch mode before
switching transports:

```bash
revyl dev --platform ios --force-hot-reload
```

This still requires Expo startup and Revyl relay transport to succeed. It skips
only the manifest and bundle proof so the cloud device can be the source of
truth. If the app loads, keep working. If the dev client shows a project load
error, restart Expo/Metro or capture a report.

Before switching to Expo tunnel fallback, gather device evidence:

```bash
revyl device screenshot -s <session-index>
revyl device report --session-id <session-id> --json
```

Continue using the relay if screenshots show the app downloading/loading or the
report/network evidence shows successful fetches from the relay host printed by
`revyl dev`. Only fall back for Expo/React Native dev-client projects if the
device remains on a dev-client error screen, the report shows no successful
relay fetches, or the app loads but hot reload is not applying changes.

For Flutter, Swift/iOS, native Android, KMP, Bazel, and other rebuild-first
stacks, do not switch to an Expo tunnel. These stacks do not use the
Metro/Expo transport path. If changes do not appear, inspect `revyl dev status`,
the last build output, and the device screenshot. Then trigger
`revyl dev rebuild --wait` from a separate shell, or stop and restart the loop
if the rebuild session is unhealthy.

If fallback is needed, start Expo in a long-running terminal and pass the full
dev-client link that Expo prints, not just the raw `*.exp.direct` URL:

```bash
CURSOR_AGENT=1 npx expo start --tunnel --dev-client
revyl dev --no-build --app-id <app-id> --tunnel '<full Expo dev-client link>'
```

```
Shell(command="revyl dev --no-build --app-id <app-id>", block_until_ms=0)
AwaitShell(pattern="Dev loop ready", block_until_ms=120000)

# Or attach to an existing context
Shell(command="revyl dev list")
Shell(command="revyl dev attach active --context <name>")
Shell(command="revyl dev --context <name>", block_until_ms=0)
AwaitShell(pattern="Dev loop ready", block_until_ms=120000)

Shell(command="revyl device screenshot")
Shell(command="revyl device tap --target 'Login button'")
```
